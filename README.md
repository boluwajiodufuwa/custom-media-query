# MediaQuery

Vaadin 14 Java integration of https://github.com/PolymerElements/iron-media-query

## Development instructions

Starting the test/demo server:
```
mvn -Pdemo jetty:run
```

This deploys demo at http://localhost:8080

### Branching information

* `master` the latest version


### Notes

In future, I hope the CSS Container Queries will be supported and this addon will be refactored to remove Polymer and the javascript dependency to emulate a container query.
